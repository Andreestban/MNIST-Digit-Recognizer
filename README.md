credits for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

Model present in repositary is trained in 35700  gray scaled images, and validated on 6300 images over 100 epochs.
Model uses various Conv-2d,max_pool2d,Dropout layers along with core keras layers.
Model provides great accuracy as shown in graph-plot, and file "val_results_model.csv" for total validation accuracy and file "train_results_model.csv" for trian data accuracy can be visited in repository for checking over accuracy and losses in each epochs.
